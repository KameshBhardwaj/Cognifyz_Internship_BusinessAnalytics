# Cognifyz Internship: Business Analytics Tasks

Welcome to my repository showcasing my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies** as a Business Analyst Intern. During this internship, I am working on analyzing datasets, performing data visualization, and applying analytical techniques to derive insights. Below are the completed tasks I have worked on so far.

## Tasks Overview

- **Task 1: Data Overview** – Understanding the structure of the dataset and performing descriptive analysis.
- **Task 2: Gender Distribution** – Visualizing the gender distribution in the dataset through graphical representations.
- **Task 3: Descriptive Statistics** – Calculating the mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
- **Task 4: Most Preferred Investment Avenue** – Identifying the most preferred investment avenue in the dataset.

## Completed Tasks

### **Task 1: Data Overview**
- **Objective**: Understand the dataset structure.
- **Steps**:
  1. Load the dataset into Python using pandas.
  2. Perform descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
- **Files**:
  - Notebook: [`internship_analysis_task_1.ipynb`](./internship_analysis_task_1.ipynb)
  - Dataset: [`Dataset.csv`](./Dataset.csv)
- **Key Results**:
  - Dataset contains 40 rows and 5 columns.
  - No missing values or duplicates.

### **Task 2: Gender Distribution**
- **Objective**: Visualize the gender distribution in the dataset.
- **Steps**:
  1. Extract the `gender` column and count the distribution.
  2. Create visualizations (bar chart and pie chart) to represent the data.
- **Files**:
  - Notebook: [`internship_analysis_task_2.ipynb`](./internship_analysis_task_2.ipynb)
  - Dataset: [`Dataset.csv`](./Dataset.csv)
  - Video: The video for Task 2 is available on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamesh-bhardwaj-270005321/).
- **Key Results**:
  - Gender counts: Male - 25, Female - 15.
  - Visualizations include a bar chart and a pie chart.

### **Task 3: Descriptive Statistics**
- **Objective**: Calculate descriptive statistics for numerical columns in the dataset.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify numerical columns using pandas.
  2. Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for each numerical column.
- **Files**:
  - Notebook: [`internship_analysis_task_3.ipynb`](./internship_analysis_task_3.ipynb)
  - Dataset: [`Dataset.csv`](./Dataset.csv)
  - Video: The video for Task 3 is available on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamesh-bhardwaj-270005321/).
- **Key Results**:
  - Numerical columns include age, Mutual Funds, Equity Market, Debentures, Government Bonds, Fixed Deposits, PPF, and Gold.
  - Key statistics such as average age (27.8 years) and preferences across investments were identified.

### **Task 4: Most Preferred Investment Avenue**
- **Objective**: Identify the most preferred investment avenue.
- **Steps**:
  1. Sum the scores for each investment avenue.
  2. Identify the avenue with the highest score using pandas' `idxmax()` function.
- **Files**:
  - Notebook: [`internship_analysis_task_4.ipynb`](./internship_analysis_task_4.ipynb)
  - Dataset: [`Dataset.csv`](./Dataset.csv)
  - Video: The video for Task 4 is available on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamesh-bhardwaj-270005321/).
- **Key Results**:
  - Total scores: Gold (239), Debentures (230), Government Bonds (186), Fixed Deposits (143), Equity Market (139), Mutual Funds (102), PPF (81).
  - The most preferred investment avenue is **Gold**, with a total score of 239.
