# Cognifyz Internship: Business Analytics Tasks

Welcome to my repository showcasing my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies** as a Business Analyst Intern. During this internship, I am working on analyzing datasets, performing data visualization, and applying analytical techniques to derive insights. Below are the completed tasks I have worked on so far.

## Tasks Overview

- **Task 1: Data Overview** – Understanding the structure of the dataset and performing descriptive analysis.
- **Task 2: Gender Distribution** – Visualizing the gender distribution in the dataset through graphical representations.

## Completed Tasks

### **Task 1: Data Overview**
- **Objective**: Understand the dataset structure.
- **Steps**:
  1. Load the dataset into Python using pandas.
  2. Perform descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
- **Files**:

### **Task 2: Gender Distribution**
- **Objective**: Visualize the gender distribution in the dataset.
- **Steps**:
  1. Extract the `gender` column and count the distribution.
  2. Create visualizations (bar chart and pie chart) to represent the data.
